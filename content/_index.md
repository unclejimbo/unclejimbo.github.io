Hi! My name is Shaodong Wang (王少东), or 'unclejimbo' on the internet.

Currently, I'm a graphics programmer at WeChat, Tencent, working on graphics engine architect, rendering algorithms, optimizations, and tooling.

Before that, I received my PhD in computer graphics from Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Science, focusing on geometry processing.
