# not much

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imgios/not-much/main/images/tn.png" />

`not-much` is a minimal Hugo theme that I use for my personal website. It doesn't have any fancy shortcode or useless feature.

**It's basic, simple and minimal.**

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Hugo

### Installing

Clone this repository in your machine:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/imgios/not-much.git
```

Change the workdir to `not-much/exampleSite` and start the Hugo server:

```shell
$ cd not-much/exampleSite
$ hugo server -D
hugo server -D
Watching for changes in \not-much\{archetypes,assets,exampleSite,i18n,layouts,static}
Watching for config changes in \not-much\exampleSite\config.toml
Start building sites â€¦
...
Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1)
Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

Now you are ready to update the theme and see the changes live @ [localhost](http://localhost:1313/).

## Deployment

The theme can be installed in two different ways:

1. By adding `not-much` as submodule in your Hugo website repository

```shell
$ cd your-hugo-website
$ git submodule add https://github.com/imgios/not-much.git themes/not-much
```

2. By adding the `not-much` theme dir in `/your-hugo-website/themes/*`

The first option is quite limited as you won't be able to edit the templates if you wanted to. The second option, on the other hand, gives you the entire structure of the theme and allows you to customise it as you wish.

Once done, update (or add) the `theme` parameter in your website configuration file to `theme = not-much`.
